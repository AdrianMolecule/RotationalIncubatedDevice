This is the basic code for a generic rotational device like the orbital shaker or tube rotator
it supports temperature and microstepping where available and a extremly powerful web interface that allows you to even change the pins for the sensors etc so you can accommodate any types of boards.Works well and I'm using both cores so the UI still responds enven if the backend is blocking (which is not at this point anyway).
